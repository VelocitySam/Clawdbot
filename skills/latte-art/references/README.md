# Reference Photo Guidelines

Place reference photos in this folder (`references/`) for score calibration.

## Required Photos

| Filename | Score | What to Capture |
|----------|-------|-----------------|
| `score-10.jpg` | 10.00 | Perfect rosetta or tulip. Symmetrical, crisp edges, ideal contrast |
| `score-9.jpg` | 9.00-9.99 | Near-perfect. Minor edge imperfection only |
| `score-8.jpg` | 8.00-8.99 | Excellent symmetry and flow. Professional quality |
| `score-7.jpg` | 7.00-7.99 | Good pattern. Slight asymmetry, still impressive |
| `score-6.jpg` | 6.00-6.99 | Acceptable. Visible issues but recognizable pattern |
| `score-5.jpg` | 5.00-5.99 | Average. Basic pattern, needs technique work |
| `score-4.jpg` | 4.00-4.99 | Below average. Weak pattern, unclear structure |
| `score-3.jpg` | 3.00-3.99 | Poor. Bad flow, asymmetric, poor definition |
| `score-2.jpg` | 2.00-2.99 | Very poor. Barely recognizable as latte art |
| `score-1.jpg` | 1.00-1.99 | Failed. No discernible pattern |

## How to Use Reference Photos

1. Take photos of your best and worst pours
2. Rate them yourself using the criteria
3. Save as `score-X.jpg` where X is your rating
4. The skill will compare new photos to these references

## Tips for Great Reference Photos

- Use the same cup and background for consistency
- Ensure consistent lighting conditions
- Include the full cup in frame
- Center the latte art in the photo
- Avoid shadows on the foam
