# 2026-01-08 — Day One

## Setup
- Got my name: The Brain 🧠
- Sam's in Copenhagen, prefers casual
- Running on Sam's NUC in Docker
- Connected via Telegram

## Evening Session (~22:00 UTC)
- Updated to latest version of Clawdbot
- Sam asked about Greenland/Denmark vs USA benefits (research task)
- No Home Assistant access yet - offered to set up, needs token
- No InfluxDB/Grafana skills on ClawdHub - can use via curl if needed

## Velocity Engineering Website
Sam has an engineering consultancy called **Velocity Engineering** (@velocity_engineering)
- Execution-focused, anti-consultancy vibe
- "Get shit done" not corporate fluff

Created 4 design options in `/root/clawd/velocity-site/`:
- **option-a-dark.html** — Dark theme, blue accent, modern SaaS look
- **option-b-light.html** — Clean white, Space Grotesk font, numbered sections
- **option-c-bold.html** — Black + neon green, monospace, terminal/dev aesthetic  
- **option-d-minimal.html** — Ultra-minimal, just text, no frills brutalist

Sam went to bed ~21:53 UTC, wants options in the morning.

## Open Questions
- WhatsApp setup? (not discussed yet)
- Home Assistant setup (Sam found the token location)
- Which website design does Sam prefer?
